Common
1. OOPS Concept
OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming, consisting of four key concepts:

Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class).
Inheritance: One class acquires the properties of another class (extends keyword in Java/Kotlin).
Polymorphism: Ability to take many forms. Achieved via method overloading and overriding.
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality (using abstract classes or interfaces).

Example:

open class Animal {
    open fun sound() {
        println("Animal makes a sound")
    }
}

class Dog : Animal() {
    override fun sound() {
        println("Dog barks")
    }
}
2. Multiple Inheritance in Android
Java/Kotlin does not support multiple inheritance to avoid ambiguity. However, multiple inheritance is achieved using interfaces.

Example:

interface Movable {
    fun move()
}

interface Flyable {
    fun fly()
}

class Bird : Movable, Flyable {
    override fun move() {
        println("Bird is moving")
    }

    override fun fly() {
        println("Bird is flying")
    }
}
3. What is Abstract Class?
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body).

Example:

abstract class Shape {
    abstract fun draw()
}

class Circle : Shape() {
    override fun draw() {
        println("Drawing Circle")
    }
}
1. Explain Activity Lifecycle
Activity lifecycle includes the following methods:

onCreate(): Called when the activity is first created.
onStart(): Called when the activity becomes visible.
onResume(): Called when the activity starts interacting with the user.
onPause(): Called when the activity is partially obscured.
onStop(): Called when the activity is no longer visible.
onRestart(): Called after the activity is stopped, prior to being started again.
onDestroy(): Called before the activity is destroyed.

Example:

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    // Activity initialization code
}
2. Explain Fragment Lifecycle
Fragment lifecycle includes:

01. onAttach()
Called when the fragment is first attached to its parent activity. Use this to obtain a reference to the activity or context.

02. onCreate()
Called when the fragment is being created. Used to initialize non-UI components like data or saved states.

03. onCreateView()
Called to inflate the fragment's layout. It returns the root view of the fragment's UI.

04. onActivityCreated()
Called when the host activity's onCreate() has completed. Useful for final UI setup and interacting with the activity.

05. onStart()
Called when the fragment is visible to the user. You can set up observers or register components here.

06. onResume()
Called when the fragment is active and interacting with the user. This is where you handle UI interactions.

07. onPause()
Called when the fragment is partially obscured. Use it to pause ongoing tasks (e.g., animations, sensors).

08. onStop()
Called when the fragment is no longer visible. Useful for stopping background processes or saving data.

09. onDestroyView()
Called when the view hierarchy of the fragment is being destroyed. Clean up view references to avoid memory leaks.

10. onDestroy()
Called to perform any final cleanup of the fragmentâ€™s state, such as releasing resources.

11. onDetach()
Called when the fragment is detached from the parent activity. Typically used for cleanup related to the activity's context.

Example:

override fun onCreateView(
    inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?, savedInstanceState: Bundle?
): View? {
    return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_example, container, false)
}
3. What is Context?

Kotlin
01. Why choose Kotlin over Java?
Kotlin offers several advantages over Java:

Conciseness: Kotlin reduces boilerplate code significantly.
Null Safety: Kotlin has built-in null safety, reducing NullPointerException risks.
Interoperability: Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, meaning you can use both in the same project.
Coroutines: Kotlin supports coroutines for asynchronous programming, which simplifies managing background threads.
Smart Casts: Kotlin automatically casts variables without requiring explicit checks.

Example: Null safety in Kotlin:

val name: String? = null  // Nullable type
val length = name?.length ?: 0  // Uses the Elvis operator to provide a default value
02. What is the difference between val and var keywords?
val: Immutable reference, similar to final in Java. Once assigned, its value cannot change.
var: Mutable reference. Its value can be changed after initialization.

Example:

val name = "Kotlin"  // Immutable
var age = 25         // Mutable
03. What are the scoped functions in Kotlin?
Kotlin provides several scoped functions to work with objects in concise and readable ways:

let: Executes a block of code and returns its result.
run: Executes a block and returns the last expression.
apply: Modifies the receiver and returns the object itself.
also: Similar to apply but for additional actions.
with: A non-extension function used for context object access.

Example:

val result = "Kotlin".let {
    it.uppercase()
}
println(result) // KOTLIN
04. What is the Companion Object code block?
A companion object is used to define members that are tied to the class rather than to instances of the class, similar to static members in Java.

Example:

class MyClass {
    companion object {
        fun create() = MyClass()
    }
}

val instance = MyClass.create()
05. What is the Elvis operator?
The Elvis operator (?:) is used to provide a default value if the left-hand expression is null.

Example:

val length: Int = name?.length ?: 0
06. What is a nullable type?
In Kotlin, you can declare a variable that can hold a null value by appending a ? to its type.

Example:

val name: String? = null
07. What is Coroutine?
Coroutines are Kotlin's way of handling asynchronous programming. They allow execution of long-running tasks without blocking the main thread, ensuring smooth UI interactions.

Example:

GlobalScope.launch {
    delay(1000L)
    println("Coroutine!")
}
08. Difference between async and launch in Coroutine?
launch: Launches a coroutine that doesnâ€™t return a result.
async: Launches a coroutine that returns a Deferred object, which holds a result.

Example:

val result = GlobalScope.async {
    delay(1000L)
    "Hello"
}.await()

GlobalScope.launch {
    println("World")
}
09. Example for filter function usage
The filter function is used to filter elements from a collection based on a predicate.

Example:

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
println(evenNumbers)  // Output: [2, 4]
10. What is an Open class?
In Kotlin, classes are final by default. To allow a class to be inherited, you must declare it as open.

Example:

open class Parent
class Child : Parent()
11. What is a Data Class?
A data class in Kotlin is a class primarily used to hold data. It automatically provides equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and copy() methods.

Example:

data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
12. How to use Lambda function?
A lambda function is a function literal, which can be passed as an argument or stored in a variable.

Example:

val sum: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b }
println(sum(2, 3))  // Output: 5
13. What is a Suspend function?
A suspend function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed. It's used in coroutines for long-running tasks.

Example:

suspend fun fetchData() {
    delay(1000L)
    println("Data fetched")
}
14. Available scopes of Coroutine?
GlobalScope: A coroutine scope that spans the entire application's lifecycle.
CoroutineScope: Allows the creation of a custom scope tied to lifecycle components.
viewModelScope: Used with ViewModel in Android.
lifecycleScope: Tied to the lifecycle of an Android component.

Example:

lifecycleScope.launch {
    // Coroutine within lifecycle scope
}
15. What is a Sealed class?
A sealed class is a restricted class hierarchy where all possible subclasses are known at compile time. This makes it useful for handling restricted options like in a state machine.

Example:

sealed class Shape
class Circle : Shape()
class Rectangle : Shape()
16. How to handle exception in Coroutine?
You can handle exceptions in coroutines using try-catch or by using a CoroutineExceptionHandler.

Example:

val exceptionHandler = CoroutineExceptionHandler { _, exception ->
    println("Caught $exception")
}

GlobalScope.launch(exceptionHandler) {
    try {
        throw Exception("Error")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Caught in catch: ${e.message}")
    }
}
MVVM
01. What is two-way data binding?
Two-way data binding allows changes in the UI to automatically update the underlying data, and vice versa. It ensures that if the data changes, the UI reflects the change, and if the user interacts with the UI (e.g., input in a text field), the underlying data model gets updated.

Example:

<EditText
    android:id="@+id/editText"
    android:text="@={viewModel.userName}" />
In the above, any change in userName in the ViewModel will reflect in the EditText, and any user input in the EditText will update userName in the ViewModel.

02. What is the ViewModel?
The ViewModel is a component in the MVVM architecture that holds and manages UI-related data. It survives configuration changes (like screen rotations) and interacts with the Model to get data for the View. It ensures the separation of UI logic from business logic.

Example:

class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    val userName = MutableLiveData<String>()
}
03. Difference between MVVM and MVP?
The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architectures are both popular design patterns for structuring Android applications, but they have key differences in how they separate concerns and handle communication between components.

1. Structure and Responsibilities:
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):
MVP (Model-View-Presenter):

2. Communication Flow:
MVVM:The View binds to properties in the ViewModel using data-binding or observing LiveData.The ViewModel communicates with the Model to retrieve or update data but doesn't directly update the View. Instead, the View observes the ViewModel for changes.
MVP:The Presenter communicates with both the View and the Model. The Presenter takes user input from the View and updates the View with changes in the Model. This direct communication between the Presenter and View can lead to tighter coupling.

3. Coupling and Testability:
MVVM:
MVP:

4. Use of Data Binding:
MVVM:
MVP:

04. How to use MVVM?
To implement MVVM:

Model: Define your data source or repository.
ViewModel: Create ViewModel classes to hold and manage UI data.
View: Use XML layouts and data binding to connect UI elements to ViewModel properties.

Example:

Model: Data class or repository fetching from an API or database.
ViewModel: LiveData holds data.
View: XML with data binding or observing LiveData.

Jetpack
01. What is the Navigation Component?
The Navigation Component in Jetpack is a framework for navigating between fragments or activities, providing a consistent and declarative way to manage app navigation and handle deep links.

Example: Using a navigation graph:

<fragment
    android:id="@+id/firstFragment"
    android:name="com.example.FirstFragment"
    tools:layout="@layout/fragment_first" />
02. What is the Room database?
Room is an abstraction over SQLite in Android that provides an easy way to create, manage, and query databases. It offers compile-time checking of SQL queries and integrates with LiveData and coroutines.

Example:

@Entity
data class User(@PrimaryKey val id: Int, val name: String)

@Dao
interface UserDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM user")
    fun getAllUsers(): LiveData<List<User>>
}

@Database(entities = [User::class], version = 1)
abstract class AppDatabase : RoomDatabase() {
    abstract fun userDao(): UserDao
}
03. What are the Jetpack components?

binding.textView.text = "Hello, View Binding!"
Design
01. What is the difference between guideline and barrier in ConstraintLayout?
Guideline: A static, invisible line used to align views. Can be horizontal or vertical.
Barrier: A dynamic constraint that adjusts based on the size of other views. It pushes other views and adjusts according to the content size.

Example:

Use a guideline for aligning views to a specific point.
Use a barrier when the position depends on the size of another view.

02. What is the ems property of TextView?
The ems property defines the width of a TextView in terms of the width of a capital "M" in the current text size. It essentially sets a fixed width for the text element.

Example:

<TextView
    android:ems="10"
    android:text="Hello" />
03. What is chainStyle in ConstraintLayout?
chainStyle defines the behavior of views that are part of a chain in ConstraintLayout. There are three styles:

spread: Views are evenly distributed.
spread_inside: First and last views are attached to the parent, and the rest are distributed evenly.
packed: Views are packed together.

Example:

app:layout_constraintHorizontal_chainStyle="packed"
04. Can we use Material Components in layouts with AppCompat themes?
Yes, Material Components can be used with AppCompat themes, but it's recommended to use Material themes (Theme.MaterialComponents.*) for full compatibility.

05. What is Motion Layout?
MotionLayout is a subclass of ConstraintLayout that provides animation and transition capabilities. It allows you to define complex animations and layout transitions in XML.

Example:

<MotionScene>
    <Transition>
        <KeyFrameSet>
            <KeyPosition ... />
        </KeyFrameSet>
    </Transition>
</MotionScene>
